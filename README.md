# WordCloudGenv5
A word cloud gen I made for a research project 

The program does make a settings.json file in your home dir, all it does is remeber if you left dark mode on and what exclusion list you last used!



So like this program is kinda mid low key but its neat. Coded with help from your local friendly LLM Gemini! 
(I vibe coded this, im sorry programming jesus)




side notes:
the exe takes forever, Im assuming its because its python. 
the defualt exclusion list is related to CS2 scams! 
I will rewrite this program to be faster at somepoint, along with being more of my code.
Im not proud of the amount of AI I used to make this.
